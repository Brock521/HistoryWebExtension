I have set up the get request on the server so need to call if on the client and display the data

I think we should try and do single entries instead of updating the existing one
This makes it easier to track times accessed and total duration
This should be pretty each to fix on the backend by adjusting the schema

Also note...Use the uid for the id NOT THE EXTENSION ID

Have lost some tab info previously but note sure why...id was in the response before post
and removed from the buffer and not sent. So there must be some async issue

A few things to consider right now. Clicking a filter button will reset the sorted
column which may be fine rightnow. Also I need to reset the old button symbols when a new sort button is clicked

We can add average session length, last session length
